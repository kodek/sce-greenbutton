[![Go](https://github.com/kodek/sce-greenbutton/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/kodek/sce-greenbutton/actions/workflows/go.yml)

A project to simulate the different SCE rates based on historical usage. In the future, it will also be able to simulate solar and storage (ideally to compare Powerwall settings).
